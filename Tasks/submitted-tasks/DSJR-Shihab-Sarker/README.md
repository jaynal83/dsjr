# Data Processing Tasks Day - 02

This repository contains data cleaning and transformation tasks for two datasets: **VEGIEHAT Pilot Database** and **Air Quality Data**. The goal is to preprocess these datasets to ensure they are structured, tidy, and ready for analysis.

## 1. VEGIEHAT Pilot Database  
A crowd-sourced dataset capturing food and vegetable prices in Bangladesh. Data processing involved:  
- Extracting submission details (ID, date, time, user, location).  
- Standardizing and separating selected food items.  
- Cleaning price values and structuring them per unit.  
- Analyzing item selection frequencies, particularly for **Soybean Oil** and **Eggs**.

## 2. Air Quality Data  
Hourly PM2.5 concentration measurements across major Bangladeshi cities (2012â€“2021). Processing steps included:  
- Extracting **date** and **time** components.  
- Assigning **city names** based on worksheet names.  
- Cleaning and structuring PM2.5 and temperature readings.
