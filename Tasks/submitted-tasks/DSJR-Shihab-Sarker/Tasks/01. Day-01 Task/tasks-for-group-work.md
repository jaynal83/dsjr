# Group Work Task: Data Requirements & Data Dictionary

Welcome to the group work session! In this session, you will work on identifying data requirements for a given research objective. Identify the necessary data/variables, create a data dictionary that outlines essential variables. 

---

<!--
## Overview

We will assign **one** of the following research objectives to a group:

1. **Public Health in Bangladesh – Dengue Outbreak Prevention**  
2. **Essential Food & Vegetable Price Monitoring in Bangladesh**

 Each group will focus on the assigned research objective, determine what data is needed, and build a data dictionary to support the research.

## Task 1: Public Health in Bangladesh – Dengue Outbreak Prevention

### Research Objective
> *"To predict dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh as a function of climate, mosquito population, and healthcare variables so that we can recommend a control measure to limit the future dengue."*

### Steps

1. **Identify Data Requirements:**  
   - **Brainstorm Data Sources:**  
     Consider different types of data that can help address this objective, such as:
     - **xxxx:**   xxxxxx
     - **yyy:** yyyy  
     - **zzz:** zzz  
     - **aaaaaa:** aaaaa  

2. **Create a Data Dictionary:**  
   For each potential variable, define:
   - **Variable Name:** (e.g., `var1`, `var2`)
   - **Description:** What the variable represents.  
   - **Data Type:**   
   - **Possible Values/Format:** Typical ranges or constraints.  
   - **Data Source:** Where you expect the data to come from 

3. **Deliverables:**  
   - A structured list of data requirements, organized by category (xxx, yyyy zzz, etc).  
   - A data dictionary table with at least 5 variables per data category

## Task 2: Essential Food & Vegetable Price Monitoring in Bangladesh

### Research Objective
> *"To analyze daily price fluctuations of essential food and vegetables and predict the future price in Bangladesh to help consumers and policymakers."*

### Steps

1. **Identify Data Requirements:**  
   - **Brainstorm Data Sources:**  
     Consider different types of data that can help address this objective, such as:
     - **xxxx:**   xxxxxx
     - **yyy:** yyyy  
     - **zzz:** zzz  
     - **aaaaaa:** aaaaa  

2. **Create a Data Dictionary:**  
   For each potential variable, define:
   - **Variable Name:** (e.g., `var1`, `var2`)
   - **Description:** What the variable represents.  
   - **Data Type:**   
   - **Possible Values/Format:** Typical ranges or constraints.  
   - **Data Source:** Where you expect the data to come from 

3. **Deliverables:**  
   - A structured list of data requirements, organized by category (xxx, yyyy zzz, etc).  
   - A data dictionary table with at least 5 variables per data category

## General Guidelines for Both Tasks

- **Collaboration:**  
  Work as a team to brainstorm and discuss what data is essential to answer the research objective effectively. The domain knowledge of the problem guides which data should be explored.

- **Documentation:**  
  Document all your data requirements. Organize your notes into logical categories that match the research objective.

- **Data Dictionary:**  
  Create a table (or multiple tables) that outlines:
  - **Variable Name**
  - **Description**
  - **Data Type**
  - **Possible Values/Format**
  - **Data Source**

- **Presentation:**  
  Prepare a summary of your findings.

- **Consider Challenges:**  
  Discuss potential challenges, and any privacy or ethical considerations.
