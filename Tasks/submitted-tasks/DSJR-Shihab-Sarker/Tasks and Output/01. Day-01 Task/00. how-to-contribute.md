# Forking a GitHub Repository, Uploading a File, and Creating a Pull Request

## Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Go to the [GitHub website](https://github.com/) and login
2. Navigate to the repository [DSJR](https://github.com/jaynal83/dsjr)
3. Click on the **Fork** button in the top-right corner
4. You may need to provide a new name for the repository, for example, dsjr-xx, replace xx as per your own choice. The repository name should be unique and GitHub will check it automatically
5. GitHub will create a copy of the repository in your account

## Step 2: Upload a File to the Forked Repository
There are two ways to upload a file: using the GitHub web interface or via Git. You will be using GitHub Web interface as outlined below:

### Using the GitHub Web Interface
1. Open your forked repository on GitHub
2. Click **Add file** > **Upload files**
3. Click **Choose your files** and select the file to upload
4. Add a commit message and click **Commit changes**

## Step 3: Create a Pull Request
1. Go to the **original repository** on GitHub (not the one that you forked), in this case it will be [DSJR](https://github.com/jaynal83/dsjr)
2. Click **Pull Requests** > **New Pull Request**
3. Select **Compare Across Forks** (if needed)
4. Choose your fork and branch that contains the new file
5. Click **Create Pull Request**.
6. Add a **title and description**, then click **Create Pull Request** again

Your pull request is now created and can be reviewed by the repository maintainers
